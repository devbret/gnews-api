This Python program fetches news articles from the GNews API based on a list of specified keywords. For each keyword, it sends an API request, logs detailed information including start time, duration and any errors, then stores the resultsâ€”containing keyword, timestamp and related articles in a structured JSON format saved to `gnews_results.txt`. It also writes a full log of the process, including API call timings and overall script duration, to `gnews_log.txt` for transparency and debugging purposes.
